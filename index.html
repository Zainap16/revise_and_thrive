        <h2>Welcome to Revive & Thrive</h2>
        <p>Revive & Thrive tackles the shortage of student housing by repurposing abandoned buildings into modern, comfortable living spaces. By collaborating with local governments and private developers, we transform these unused structures into vibrant student communities. This approach not only provides much-needed accommodation but also contributes to urban regeneration.</p>
